[introduction]
= Introduction

RESTful Events is a RESTful web service for creating and showing events. It uses hypermedia
to describe the relationships between resources and to allow navigation between them.

== Running the service
RESTful Events is written using http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] which
makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

The first step is to clone the Git repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/jsug-projects/flaky-events
----

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd flaky-events
$ ./mvnw clean package
$ java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=development target/*.jar
----

TIP: If you omit "development" profile, authorization needed as resource server.


You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using
cURL:

include::{snippets}{docIdBase}/index/1/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should yield the following response in the
http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application Language (HAL)] format:

include::{snippets}{docIdBase}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

Note the `_links` in the JSON response. They are key to navigating the API.
